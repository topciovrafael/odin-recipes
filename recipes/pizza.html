<p>Tastiest Pizza in the whole world! You wonder how can you make it at home?</p>
<p>We'll bring you the answer!</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>2 ½ cups warm water(600 mL)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
<li>2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
<li>7 cups all-purpose flour(875 g), plus more for dusting</li>
<li>6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing</li>
<li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
<li>¼ cup semolina flour(30 g)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>In large bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in water; let stand for 5 minutes. Add oil and salt. Stir in flour, 1 cup at a time, until a soft dough forms.</li>
<li>Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 2-3 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, cook beef and onion over medium heat until beef is no longer pink, breaking meat into crumbles; drain.</li>
<li>Punch down dough; divide in half. Press each half into a greased 12-in. pizza pan. Combine the tomato sauce, oregano and basil; spread over each crust. Top with beef mixture, green pepper and cheese.</li>
<li>Bake at 400° for 25-30 minutes or until crust is lightly browned.</li>
